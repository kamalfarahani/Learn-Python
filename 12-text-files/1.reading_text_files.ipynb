    "## Text files\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, working with text files involves opening, reading, writing, and closing files using **file objects**. A file object is a Python object that represents a file on the computer's file system. Text files are those files that contain human-readable text, such as plain text files or files that store data in a readable format, such as CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the basic steps to work with text files in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Opening a file: To open a text file, you can use the built-in `open()` function in Python which takes two arguments: the file name and the mode in which the file is opened. For example, to open a file named `example.txt` in read mode, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reading from a file: Once a file is opened, you can read from it using the `read()` method of the file object. For example, to read the entire contents of the file, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can also use the `readline()` method to read a single line from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Writing to a file: To write to a file, you can open the file in write mode (`'w'`) or append mode (`'a'`) using the `open()` function. Then, you can use the `write()` method of the file object to write data to the file. For example, to write a string to a file named `example.txt`, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Closing a file: Once you are done working with a file, you should close it using the `close()` method of the file object. This frees up any system resources used by the file. For example, to close a file named `example.txt`, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that it is a good practice to use the `with` statement when working with files in Python. This ensures that the file is automatically closed when the block of code inside the `with` statement is exited. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `with` statement automatically closes the file once the block of code is executed, even if an exception occurs."

    "### Opening file using `with` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement is a Python construct that is used to simplify the process of opening and closing a file. When you open a file in Python, you need to ensure that you close the file once you are done working with it to free up any system resources used by the file. The `with` statement automatically takes care of closing the file for you when you are done working with it, which makes your code more concise and less error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use the `with` statement to open a file in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    for line in file:\n",
    "        # do some work\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `with` statement opens the file `example.txt` in read mode and assigns the file object to the variable `file`. The `read()` method is used to read the contents of the file, and then the file is automatically closed when the block of code inside the `with` statement is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `with` statement has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It's concise: The `with` statement allows you to open and close a file in a single line of code, which makes your code more concise and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It's more readable: The `with` statement clearly defines the scope of the file object, which makes your code more readable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It's safer: The `with` statement ensures that the file is always closed, even if an error occurs during the execution of the block of code inside the `with` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It's more efficient: The `with` statement automatically releases the system resources associated with the file object when the block of code inside the `with` statement is complete, which makes your code more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using the `with` statement to open and close files in Python is a best practice that makes your code more concise, readable, safer, and more efficient."
