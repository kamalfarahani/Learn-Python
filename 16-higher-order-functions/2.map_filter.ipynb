    "## `map` and `filter`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `map` and `filter` functions are built-in higher-order functions that operate on iterables (such as lists, tuples, or strings) and allow you to perform transformations or filtering on the elements of the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `map(function, iterable)`:\n",
    "   The `map` function applies a given function to each item in the iterable and returns an iterator with the results. It takes two arguments: the `function` to be applied and the `iterable` on which the function will be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's an example that demonstrates how `map()` works:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
    "   print(list(squared_numbers))  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `lambda` function `lambda x: x ** 2` squares each element in the `numbers` list using `map()`. The `map()` function returns an iterator, which we convert to a list to print the squared numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `filter(function, iterable)`:\n",
    "   The `filter` function constructs an iterator from elements of the `iterable` for which the given `function` returns `True`. It takes two arguments: the `function` to be applied and the `iterable` on which the function will be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's an example that demonstrates how `filter` works:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "   print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `lambda` function `lambda x: x % 2 == 0` filters out the odd numbers from the `numbers` list using `filter()`. The `filter()` function returns an iterator that contains only the elements for which the function returns `True`, and we convert it to a list to print the even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `map()` and `filter()` functions provide a concise way to perform common operations on iterables without requiring explicit loops. They are especially useful when combined with lambda functions or other callable objects."

    "### Understanding the `map` function\n",
    "\n",
    "`map` is a built-in function in Python but in this section for better understanding we will implement a simplified version of the `map` function from scratch, you can define a custom function that mimics its behavior. Here's an example implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def custom_map(function, iterable):\n",
    "    result = []\n",
    "    for item in iterable:\n",
    "        result.append(function(item))\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, the `custom_map()` function takes two arguments: `function`, which represents the function to be applied to each element, and `iterable`, which is the collection of items to be mapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the function, an empty list called `result` is initialized. Then, a loop iterates over each item in the `iterable`. For each item, the `function()` is called with the item as an argument, and the return value is appended to the `result` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `result` list, containing the mapped values, is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this `custom_map()` function similarly to the built-in `map()` function. Here's an example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "mapped_numbers = custom_map(square, numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(mapped_numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a simple `square()` function that squares a given number. We have a `numbers` list, and we use the `custom_map()` function to apply the `square()` function to each element of the `numbers` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code, it will produce the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the `custom_map()` function behaves similarly to the built-in `map()` function by applying the provided function to each element of the iterable and returning a list of the mapped values."

    "#### Python built-in `map` function\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the built-in `map` function in Python and the simplified version of `custom_map` provided in the previous cells lies in their return types and internal implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Return Type:\n",
    "   - `map`: The `map` function returns a map object, which is an iterator. To obtain the mapped values as a list, you need to explicitly convert the map object to a list using the `list` function.\n",
    "   - `custom_map`: The simplified `custom_map` implementation directly returns a list containing the mapped values. There's no need for an additional conversion step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Internal Implementation:\n",
    "   - `map`: The built-in `map` function is implemented in C, making it highly optimized and efficient. It utilizes lazy evaluation, meaning it generates the mapped values on-the-fly as you iterate over the map object. This makes it memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "   - `custom_map`: The simplified `custom_map` implementation is written in Python itself. It iterates over the input iterable and applies the provided function to each element, storing the mapped values in a separate list. This implementation does not have the lazy evaluation feature and generates the entire list of mapped values upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the built-in `map` function supports multiple iterable arguments. When provided with multiple iterables, it applies the provided function to corresponding elements from each iterable. The simplified `custom_map` implementation mentioned earlier does not have this capability and only accepts a single iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the simplified `custom_map` implementation can serve basic mapping needs, the built-in `map` function provided by Python offers better performance and flexibility due to its optimized C implementation, lazy evaluation, and support for multiple iterables."
