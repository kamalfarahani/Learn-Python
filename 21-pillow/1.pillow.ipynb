    "## Pillow\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pillow library is a popular open-source Python library used for image processing and manipulation tasks. It provides a wide range of functions and methods to create, edit, and process images in various formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key features and functionalities of the Pillow library:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Image Loading and Saving: Pillow allows you to load images from different file formats such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, and more. It also provides functions to save images in different formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Image Manipulation: You can perform various image manipulation operations using Pillow, such as resizing, cropping, rotating, flipping, and adjusting the brightness, contrast, and colors of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Image Filtering and Enhancement: Pillow supports different image filters, including blurring, sharpening, edge enhancement, and smoothing. These filters can be applied to improve image quality or achieve specific visual effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Image Drawing: You can draw shapes, lines, text, and other graphical elements on an image using the Pillow library. It provides functions to add annotations, labels, or watermarks to images.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Image Transformations: Pillow supports affine transformations like scaling, translation, rotation, and shearing. These transformations can be used to modify the geometric properties of an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Image Analysis: Pillow allows you to access and manipulate individual pixels of an image. You can retrieve pixel values, modify them, or perform operations like histogram equalization or color space conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pillow is easy to install and use, making it a popular choice for image processing tasks in Python. It provides a simple and intuitive API, and its extensive documentation offers detailed information and examples to help you get started with image processing using Pillow."

    "### Installing Pillow\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Pillow library in Python, you need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installation: First, you need to install the Pillow library. You can do this by running the following command using pip, which is the package installer for Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install pillow\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing the Library: Once you have installed Pillow, you can import it in your Python script or interactive session using the `import` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from PIL import Image\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This imports the `Image` module from the Pillow library, which contains functions and classes related to image processing."

    "### `Image` class\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Pillow library (also known as PIL or PILLOW), the `Image` class is one of the key components. It represents an image and provides a range of methods to manipulate and process image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates loading an image using PIL and manipulating its size:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "# Save the resized image\n",
    "resized_image.save(\"path/to/save/resized_image.jpg\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "In this example, we first load an image from a file using `Image.open()`. Then, we print the original size of the image using the `size` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define the desired new width and height for the resized image. We use the `resize()` method to create a new resized image with the specified dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After resizing, we print the size of the resized image. Finally, we save the resized image to a file using the `save()` method.\n",
