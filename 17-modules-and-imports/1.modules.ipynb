    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions, statements, and functions that can be imported and used in other Python programs. Modules allow you to organize code into reusable units, making it easier to manage and maintain large programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module can contain variables, functions, classes, and other objects. These objects can be accessed and used by importing the module into another Python script. Modules provide a way to encapsulate related code and create a separate namespace for the objects defined within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple module called `my_module.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# my_module.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "pi = 3.14159\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `my_module.py` defines three objects: the `greet` function, the `add_numbers` function, and the `pi` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the objects defined in `my_module.py`, you need to import the module in another Python script. Here's an example of how to import and use the module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import my_module\n",
    "\n",
    "my_module.greet(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "result = my_module.add_numbers(3, 4)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 7\n",
    "print(my_module.pi)  # Output: 3.14159\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we import the `my_module` module using the `import` statement. After importing, we can access the objects defined in the module using dot notation. We call the `greet` function, the `add_numbers` function, and access the `pi` variable defined in `my_module.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can also be imported using the `from` keyword to directly import specific objects from the module. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from my_module import greet, pi\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Bob\")  # Output: Hello, Bob!\n",
    "print(pi)  # Output: 3.14159\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we only import the `greet` function and the `pi` variable from `my_module.py`, allowing us to use them directly without referencing the module name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a rich ecosystem of standard library modules that cover a wide range of functionalities, as well as the ability to create and use custom modules. Modules offer a clean and organized approach to structuring and reusing code in Python programs."

    "### `import` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `import` statement is used to bring modules or specific objects (functions, classes, variables) from modules into the current namespace, allowing you to access and use them in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for importing a module is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `module_name` refers to the name of the module you want to import. Once imported, you can access the objects defined in the module using dot notation, such as `module_name.object_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to import the `math` module and use its `sqrt` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "result = math.sqrt(16)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 4.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `math` module is imported using `import math`. After importing, we can access the `sqrt` function defined in the `math` module as `math.sqrt()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also import specific objects from a module using the `from` keyword. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from math import sqrt\n",
    "\n",
    "result = sqrt(16)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 4.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we import only the `sqrt` function from the `math` module directly. So, we can use `sqrt()` without referencing the module name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you can import a module or object and assign it a different name using the `as` keyword. This can be useful to avoid naming conflicts or for creating shorter aliases. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math as m\n",
    "\n",
    "result = m.sqrt(16)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 4.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `math` module is imported and assigned the name `m`. So, we can access the `sqrt` function as `m.sqrt()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `import` statement can also be used to import multiple modules or objects in a single line, separated by commas. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module1, module2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This imports both `module1` and `module2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `import` statement is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to utilize external code and extend the functionality of your programs by importing modules or specific objects from modules into your code's namespace."
