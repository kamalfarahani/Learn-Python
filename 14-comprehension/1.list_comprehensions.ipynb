    "## Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, comprehension is a concise, readable and easy way to create a new iterable (e.g., list, tuple, set, or dictionary) by transforming or filtering the elements of an existing iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cover three types of comprehensions in this course: list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and set comprehensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **List comprehensions**: List comprehension is a way to create a new list by applying an expression to each element of an existing list or other iterable object. List comprehensions are enclosed in square brackets and consist of an input sequence, a variable representing each element of the input sequence, and an output expression. List comprehensions can also include a conditional expression to filter the elements of the input sequence. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9\n",
    "squares_of_even_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dictionary comprehensions**: Dictionary comprehension is a way to create a new dictionary by applying an expression to each key-value pair of an existing dictionary or other iterable object. Dictionary comprehensions are enclosed in curly braces and consist of an input sequence, a key variable representing each key of the input sequence, a value variable representing each value of the input sequence, and an output expression. Dictionary comprehensions can also include a conditional expression to filter the key-value pairs of the input sequence. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a dictionary that maps each even number from 0 to 9 to its square\n",
    "squares_of_even_numbers_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set comprehensions**: Set comprehension is a way to create a new set by applying an expression to each element of an existing set or other iterable object. Set comprehensions are enclosed in curly braces and consist of an input sequence, a variable representing each element of the input sequence, and an output expression. Set comprehensions can also include a conditional expression to filter the elements of the input sequence. Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a set of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9\n",
    "squares_of_even_numbers_set = {x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensions work well for simple cases, for complex cases they can quickly become undreadable, so use them with caution."

    "### List comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehension is a concise and expressive way to create a new list by applying an expression to each element of an existing list or other iterable object. It is one of the most frequently used features of Python and a powerful tool for working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of list comprehension in Python is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[ expression for item in iterable if condition ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- `expression` is an expression that defines the list element based on `item`.\n",
    "- `item` is a variable that takes on each value in the `iterable`.\n",
    "- `iterable` is a sequence of values that `item` takes on, such as a list, tuple, or set.\n",
    "- `condition` (optional) is an expression that filters the `item` based on some condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list comprehension expression is enclosed in square brackets `[]` and can be assigned to a variable or used directly in code. The expression is evaluated for each `item` in the `iterable`, and the resulting list contains the transformed elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a list comprehension that creates a list of squares of even numbers between 1 and 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "even_squares = [n*n for n in range(1, 11) if n % 2 == 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `expression` is simply `n*n`, which defines the list element based on `item`. `item` takes on each value in the `range(1, 11)` sequence, and the `if` statement filters out odd numbers. The resulting list `even_squares` contains the squares of even numbers between 1 and 10: `[4, 16, 36, 64, 100]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `expression` is the operation or computation that is performed on each element of the iterable, `item` is the variable used to represent each element of the iterable, `iterable` is the existing sequence that is being iterated over, and **`condition` is an optional expression that can be used to filter out elements from the new list.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and we want to create a new list of squares of even numbers from that list. Here is how we can use list comprehension to achieve that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a list of squares of even numbers from 1 to 10\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "squares_of_even_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we first define the list of numbers from 1 to 10. Then, we use list comprehension to create a new list `squares_of_even_numbers` that contains the square of each even number in the original list. The expression `x**2` computes the square of each element `x` of the iterable, and the condition `if x % 2 == 0` filters out the odd numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehension can also be nested, which makes it a powerful tool for working with nested data structures. Here is an example that uses nested list comprehension to create a new list of the Cartesian products of two lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create a list of the Cartesian products of two lists\n",
    "list_1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "list_2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    "cartesian_product = [(x, y) for x in list_1 for y in list_2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a new list `cartesian_product` that contains all the pairs of elements from `list1` and `list2`. The expression `(x, y)` creates a tuple that contains the current element `x` from `list1` and the current element `y` from `list2`. The nested loop iterates over all possible pairs of elements from the two lists."
