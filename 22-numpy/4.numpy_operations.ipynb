    "## NumPy matrix operations\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides several matrix operations that allow you to perform mathematical operations on matrices efficiently. Here are some commonly used NumPy matrix operations with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix Multiplication:** You can perform matrix multiplication using the `numpy.matmul` function or the `@` operator.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "B = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
