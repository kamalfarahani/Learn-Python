    "### Combinatorics functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arranging, and selecting objects or elements in a systematic way. Combinatorics functions are mathematical functions that are used to solve problems related to counting, permutations, combinations, and other combinatorial calculations. Here are some common combinatorics functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Factorial Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The factorial function calculates the product of all positive integers up to a given number. It is denoted by the exclamation mark ($!$). For a non-negative integer n, n factorial ($n!$) is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n",
    "   - Example: $5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120$.\n",
    "   - Factorial function is commonly used as a building block in many combinatorial calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Permutations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Permutations are the different arrangements of a set of objects in a particular order. The number of permutations of selecting r objects from a set of n objects, without repetition, is denoted as $P(n, r)$ or n P r.\n",
    "   - Example: If we have 5 letters (A, B, C, D, E) and we want to arrange 3 of them, the number of permutations is \n",
    "   $$P(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{(5 - 3)!} = 60$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Combinations are the different selections of objects from a set without considering the order. The number of combinations of selecting r objects from a set of n objects, without repetition, is denoted as $C(n, r)$ or n C r.\n",
    "   - Example: If we have 5 letters (A, B, C, D, E) and we want to select 3 of them, the number of combinations is \n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$C(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{(3! \\times (5 - 3)!)} = 10$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of combinatorics functions commonly used in mathematics and computer science. Combinatorics has a wide range of applications in various fields, including probability, statistics, computer science, and cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "in Python 3.8 and later versions, these functions have been introduced in the math module as part of the standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `math.perm(n, k)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `math.perm(n, k)` function calculates the number of permutations of `k` items from a total of `n` items.\n",
    "   - The function returns the number of possible permutations as an integer value.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, it is calculated as: `n! / (n - k)!`.\n",
    "   - Example usage:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import math\n",
    "\n",
    "     n = 5\n",
    "     k = 3\n",
    "     permutations = math.perm(n, k)\n",
    "     print(permutations)  # Output: 60\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `math.comb(n, k)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `math.comb(n, k)` function calculates the number of combinations of `k` items from a total of `n` items, also known as \"n C k\" or \"binomial coefficient\".\n",
    "   - The function returns the number of possible combinations as an integer value.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, it is calculated as: `n! / (k! * (n - k)!)`.\n",
    "   - Example usage:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import math\n",
    "\n",
    "     n = 5\n",
    "     k = 3\n",
    "     combinations = math.comb(n, k)\n",
    "     print(combinations)  # Output: 10\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions simplify the computation of permutations and combinations by providing direct methods in the math module, removing the need for manual implementation using factorials and division. It is important to note that these functions are only available in Python 3.8 and later versions. If you are using an older version of Python, you may need to implement these calculations manually or consider using external libraries such as `scipy` or `numpy` for combinatorial calculations."
