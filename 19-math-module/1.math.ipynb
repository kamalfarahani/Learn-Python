    "### Number-theoretic and Representation Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure! Here are detailed explanations of each of the functions you mentioned from the `math` module:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. `math.ceil(x)`:\r\n",
    "   The `ceil` function in the `math` module stands for \"ceiling.\" It takes a single parameter `x` and returns the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to `x`. In other words, it rounds `x` up to the nearest whole number. If `x` is already an integer, the function returns `x` itself. For example:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   import math\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   print(math.ceil(3.2))  # Output: 4\r\n",
    "   print(math.ceil(5.8))  # Output: 6\r\n",
    "   print(math.ceil(-2.5))  # Output: -2\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. `math.floor(x)`:\r\n",
    "   The `floor` function in the `math` module is the opposite of the `ceil` function. It also takes a single parameter `x` and returns the largest integer that is less than or equal to `x`. In simpler terms, it rounds `x` down to the nearest whole number. If `x` is already an integer, the function returns `x` itself. For example:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   import math\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   print(math.floor(3.2))  # Output: 3\r\n",
    "   print(math.floor(5.8))  # Output: 5\r\n",
    "   print(math.floor(-2.5))  # Output: -3\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. `math.trunc(x)`:\r\n",
    "   The `trunc` function in the `math` module returns the truncated integer value of `x`. Truncation essentially means removing the decimal part of a number without rounding it. It discards the fractional part and returns the integer portion of `x`. If `x` is positive, truncation is equivalent to flooring. If `x` is negative, truncation is equivalent to ceiling. For example:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   import math\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   print(math.trunc(3.2))   # Output: 3\r\n",
    "   print(math.trunc(5.8))   # Output: 5\r\n",
    "   print(math.trunc(-2.5))  # Output: -2\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. `math.gcd(a, b)`:\r\n",
    "   The `gcd` function in the `math` module stands for \"greatest common divisor.\" It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns the largest positive integer that divides both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder. In other words, it calculates the greatest common factor of `a` and `b`. The `gcd` function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the result. For example:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   import math\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   print(math.gcd(12, 18))  # Output: 6\r\n",
    "   print(math.gcd(9, 28))   # Output: 1\r\n",
    "   print(math.gcd(60, 48))  # Output: 12\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   In the first example, the greatest common divisor of 12 and 18 is 6 because it is the largest number that can divide both 12 and 18 without leaving a remainder. In the second example, 9 and 28 don't share any common factors other than 1, so the greatest common divisor is 1. In the third example, the greatest common divisor of 60 and 48 is 12, as 12 is the largest number that can divi behavior of the functions in the `math` module!"

    "\n",
    "Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arranging, and selecting objects or elements in a systematic way. Combinatorics functions are mathematical functions that are used to solve problems related to counting, permutations, combinations, and other combinatorial calculations. Here are some common combinatorics functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Factorial Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The factorial function calculates the product of all positive integers up to a given number. It is denoted by the exclamation mark ($!$). For a non-negative integer n, n factorial ($n!$) is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\n",
    "   - Example: $5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120$.\n",
    "   - Factorial function is commonly used as a building block in many combinatorial calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Permutations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Permutations are the different arrangements of a set of objects in a particular order. The number of permutations of selecting r objects from a set of n objects, without repetition, is denoted as $P(n, r)$ or n P r.\n",
    "   - Example: If we have 5 letters (A, B, C, D, E) and we want to arrange 3 of them, the number of permutations is \n",
    "   $$P(5, 3) = \\frac{5!}{(5 - 3)!} = 60$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combinations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Combinations are the different selections of objects from a set without considering the order. The number of combinations of selecting r objects from a set of n objects, without repetition, is denoted as $C(n, r)$ or n C r.\n",
    "   - Example: If we have 5 letters (A, B, C, D, E) and we want to select 3 of them, the number of combinations is \n",
    "   \n",

    "These functions simplify the computation of permutations and combinations by providing direct methods in the math module, removing the need for manual implementation using factorials and division. It is important to note that these functions are only available in Python 3.8 and later versions. If you are using an older version of Python, you may need to implement these calculations manually or consider using external libraries such as `scipy` or `numpy` for combinatorial calculations."
