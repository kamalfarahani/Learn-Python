    "In programming, an object is a data structure that contains both data and the methods or functions that operate on that data. Objects are the fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP), which is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects to model real-world objects and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is created from a class, which is a template or blueprint for creating objects of a particular type. The class defines the properties (data) and methods (functions) that the object will have. Once an object is created, it can be manipulated through its methods, which can read or modify its properties or perform other operations on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects provide a way to encapsulate data and behavior into a single entity, which makes it easier to manage and maintain complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in Python is an object meaning that:\n",
    "1. It has a type\n",
    "2. It has a state\n",
    "3. It has functionality\n",
    "4. It is seperate from other objects (it has its own identity)"

    "### Why to use objects and what is object oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects, which are data structures that contain data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data. In OOP, objects are the fundamental building blocks of a program, and they are used to model real-world objects and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it supports OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Python allows us to define classes, which are templates or blueprints for creating objects of a particular type. Classes can have attributes (data) and methods (functions), just like objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main advantages of OOP is that it allows us to write more modular and reusable code. By encapsulating data and behavior into objects, we can create more self-contained and coherent pieces of code. This makes it easier to maintain and extend our programs over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use OOP for a variety of tasks, from creating simple scripts to developing large-scale applications and frameworks. For example, we might use OOP to represent real-world objects like cars, employees, or bank accounts in a program. We might also use OOP to define classes and objects for GUI programming, web development, or scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, OOP is a powerful and flexible programming paradigm that is well-suited to many different types of applications. In Python, it is an essential aspect of the language that allows us to write robust and scalable code.\n",
