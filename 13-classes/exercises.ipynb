    "- keep track of a \"ledger\" that keeps a record all transactions (just use a list to keep track of this)\n",
    "    - at a minimum it should keep track of the transaction date (the current UTC datetime) and the amount (positive, or negative to indicate deposits/withdrawals) - later you could add tracking the running balance as well.\n",
    "- provide read-only properties for `first_name`, `last_name`, `account_number` and `balance`\n",
    "- provide a property to access the ledger in such a way that a user of this class cannot mutate the ledger directly\n",
    "- provide a read-write property for `is_overdraft_allowed` that indicates whether overdrafts are allowed on the account.\n",
    "- provide methods to debit (`def withdraw`) and credit (`def deposit`) transactions that:\n",
    "    - verify withdrawals against available balance and `is_overdraft_allowed` flag\n",
    "        - if withdrawal is larger than available balance and overdrafts are not allowed, this should raise a custom `OverdraftNotAllowed` exception.\n",
    "        - if transaction value is not positive, this should raise a `ValueError` exception (we have separate methods for deposits and withdrawals, and we expect the value to be positive in both cases - one will add to the balance, one will subtract from the balance).\n",
    "    - add an entry to the ledger with a current UTC timestamp (positive or negative to indicate credit/debit)\n",
    "    - keeps the available balance updated\n",
    "- implements a good string representation for the instance (maybe something like `first_name last_name (account_number): balance`"
